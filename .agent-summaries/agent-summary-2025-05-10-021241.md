# Barotrauma Modding Kit Development Summary

## Reverse Engineering Toolkit

1. **Content Cataloging (catalog_content_files.py)**
   - Recursively scans all 604 XML files in the Barotrauma Content directory
   - Calculates SHA-256 checksums for tracking changes between game versions
   - Records file metadata (size, modification time, etc.)
   - Provides a baseline for tracking our reverse engineering progress

2. **Reverse Engineering Manager (reverse_engineering_manager.py)**
   - Tracks which schemas have been reverse engineered
   - Supports adding metadata and notes about implementation details
   - Provides validation of checksums to detect game updates
   - Includes XML structure analysis to assist with schema creation
   - Generates progress statistics and reports

3. **Content Categorization (categorize_content.py)**
   - Categorizes XML files by root element, directory, and filename patterns
   - Generates a prioritized list of files for systematic reverse engineering
   - Creates a detailed report of the content structure 

4. **Documentation (schema_engineering.md)**
   - Explains the methodical approach to reverse engineering
   - Provides usage examples for the tools
   - Addresses legal considerations (we analyze structure but don't copy content)

## Key Findings from Content Analysis

The categorization reveals that Barotrauma's content primarily consists of:

- **Items (74 files)** - Various game items, equipment, and tools
- **Characters (58 files)** - Creature and NPC definitions
- **Ragdolls (58 files)** - Physics models for characters
- **Afflictions (8 files)** - Status effects and conditions
- Many specialized animation and text files

This systematic approach allows us to efficiently reverse engineer the schemas by:
1. Starting with core definitions (Items.xml, Afflictions.xml, etc.)
2. Moving to more specialized content types
3. Tracking everything to ensure completeness

All these tools and their outputs have been committed to the GitHub repository. The next step would be to begin the actual reverse engineering process, starting with the highest priority files identified in the categorization report.
